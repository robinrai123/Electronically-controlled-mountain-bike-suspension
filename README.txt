This is an embedded system that monitors terrain smoothness and rider pedalling, and in real time controls the bicycle's suspension accordingly.


aaaMainProgram.py is the main program, ran with Python. It can only be ran on a Raspberry Pi with the sensors attached, as the program uses specific GPIO libraries and GPIO pins. The same goes for DataRecorder.py used for recording sensor data, and the other .py files. The other .py files were used in development.
